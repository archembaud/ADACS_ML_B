# ADACS_ML_B
Inferencing using Keras and Tensorflow for a time-series classification problem. Part of a tutorial series created for an ADACS Machine Learning workshop.
 

## Introduction
In the previous section (ADACS_ML_A) we employed Keras for binary classification of time-series data. There we trained our machine
and tested it using the training and testing data sets provided. In this case, we investigate a script (infer.py) which
loads an exported Keras model (and previously computed weights) for a simple classification task. The material provided is designed 
to run on Swinburne University of Technology's OzStar supercomputing system. 

## Note
The data sets used for training and testing are not included with this repository - feel free to copy them from the ADACS_ML_A repository.
